- Users just want convenience, they do not care about `resource utilization`
> resource means Hardware here
- OS `allocates and controls` resources and manages execution of user programs
- When users use shared systems like servers; OS needs to manage multiple users.
- Mobile devices are resource poor; so their OS are optimized for usability and battery life
- Some systems do not have user interface. For example, embedded computers in vehicles
	- In such systems OS runs without any user intervention
