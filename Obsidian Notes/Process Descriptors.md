A process descriptor, also known as a `Process Control Block (PCB)`, is a data structure maintained by the operating system to store all the information about a specific process. It serves as a repository for essential data needed to manage and control a process. The PCB typically includes the following information:

- **Process ID (PID)**: A unique identifier for the process.
- **Process State**: The current state of the process (e.g., running, waiting, terminated).
- **CPU Registers**: The values of the CPU registers when the process is not running, allowing the system to resume execution.
- **Program Counter**: The address of the next instruction to be executed.
- **Memory Management Information**: Details about the process's address space, including base and limit registers or page tables.
- **I/O Status Information**: Information about the I/O devices allocated to the process, open files, etc.
- **Scheduling Information**: Priority of the process, scheduling queue pointers, and other scheduling parameters.
- **Accounting Information**: CPU usage, process creation time, and other accounting data.
