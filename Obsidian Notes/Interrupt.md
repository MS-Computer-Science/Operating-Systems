* **<u>An Operating System is `Interrupt Driven` </u>**
```Interrupt
- Interrupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine - thorugh interrupt vector - wich contains addresses of all the service routines
```

* If the interrupt is generated by software (error or user request) then it is called `trap` or `exception`

## Interrupt Handling
* The OS preserves the state of CPU by `storing the registers and the program counter`
* The OS also determines the type of interrupt and the action need to be taken

## Two ways of handling I/O
1. After I/O starts, control returns to user program only after I/O completion
	* `Wait` Instruction idles the CPU until next interrupt
	* At most one I/O request at a time
	* No simultaneous I/O processing
2. After I/O starts, control returns to user program without waiting for I/O completion
	* When a program starts an I/O operation, it doesn't wait for the operation to finish. Instead, it continues executing other tasks.
	- The program can make a `system call` to ask the Operating System (OS) to notify it when the I/O operation is done.
	* `Device-status table` contains entry for each I/O device indicating its type, address & state
	* OS reads from or modify in `Device-status table`
